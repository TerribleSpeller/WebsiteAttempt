                      <h2>Kaisarverse OCs</h2>
                      <hr>
                      <p>To summarise, the Kaisarverse is a setting in which most of my writing occurs. Taking place in a multiversal empire which calls itself 'MineLegotia and Equestria',  an Empire that pierced the secrets of interuniversal travel in the wake of its great war, and began to spread among the different stories found in the Multiverse. But it is an Empire in constant flux and debate within itself, debating what is right and wrong.  The state is a contradiction, for an Empire is never a monolithic leviathan, and instead a series of individuals acting out their own lives amidst a convoluted political structure. Backstabs, hope, glory, tragedy, horrors, joy, romance, and a variety more are found in the Empire. And these OCs live in a state trying to assert its own ability to live up to its ideals yet struggling every step in trying to do so. To either live by ink or to be condemned to death by it.

                      <p><b>Not all OCs have been noted here yet. More will be added whenever I have the time.</b></p>

                              Medical Atlas von Kartogrefi Yang was born on the 25th of January 2326 in an unassuming hospital in the Western Manehatten District. He was one of the 39.4 million born in the first quarter of 2326, and was insignificant and inseparable apart from the fact he was born into the family of Atom van Kartogrefi Yang and Velvet Articulate da Munensch. A family with a legacy of servitude to the MineLegoEquestrian Bureaucracy. Medical would grow up with three different siblings, Dimethane Polynominal, Scienti Johnathan Rechtan, Inked Tear, and Tripoly Equilibilirum. The first few years of life would be defined by the adoration of the Kartogrefi and Munensch family, for being the first of both families' new generation.
                            </p><p>
                              Despite such adoration, the personality developed in the early stages of Medical's life was of a secluded introvert. Seemingly more keen to be playing by himself with his toys rather than playing with his siblings, but still exhibiting the usual traits of an older brother. Protective of Scienti in particular. Probably due to the fact that Scienti like imitating Medical and tried to follow in his brother's hoofsteps. Family members would note how Medical would always keep an eye and cover for the troublesome Scienti.
                            </p><p>
                              Medical would enrol in a private school according to his father's wishes, and saw himself pass mainly mathematics and biology with ease. Here his abilities for bureaucratic management would first emerge in the form of relentless pursuit of a solution to a mathematical solution. During this part of his life, it should be noted of the thawing of his introverted ways and had begun to build a small circle of friends in which he could confide in. However, the relative safety and normalcy of his life would shatter when Scienti died of a medical complication, and the parents noted how he broke down over the death. Rejecting that Scienti had died and still believing him to be away, before finally accepting his death in 2340, a year after Scienti's death.
                            </p><p>
                              His excellence within the realm of mathematics would persist along with his natural talent within biology all the way until university. Where he would enroll in the Technical University of Manehatten (TUM) in 2344. Now during his time in the TUM, he would develop romantic feelings for a fellow student, Lavender, who he knew since high school. Everything was going well for him before it all fell apart in 2346 with the death of Lavender. Police reports dictate Lavender's death to be a suicide, and Medical's life broke down. Not knowing how to deal with the lost of another one he cared about, led to him fleeing Manehatten and temporarily dropping off the radar of his friends and family.</p>
                            </p> <p>
                            Bureaucratic archives revealed Medical Atlas moving from Manehatten to Western Griffonia under a pseudonym, "Climate Salad". A government investigation revealed this to be a rudimentary anagram. Medical threw away his pseudonym by the time he reached Western Griffonia and signed up for the Imperial Garrison, thinking it was a good way to hide for now by fulfilling his mandatory military conscription. Medical was soon deployed a year after to Callujah in the Eastern reaches of Equestria-58 of the Equestrian Multi-Union Empire, which was riddled with the occasional insurgency. It should be noted that Medical through most of his deployment was ailed with alcoholism.
                            </p><p>
                            But despite this raging alcoholism, Medical would serve as a Lance Corporal within the Imperial Garrison's logistic sections. Putting to work his bureaucratic abilities which he found several years ago. Most would note that Medical would alternate being drunk and carrying out his duties with efficiency. Seemingly without any time in between to rest.
                            </p><p>
                            Medical was deployed for a year in Callujah, where he eventually became a Corporal within the Imperial Garrison's Logistic Division. He saw involvement within the Caplanbourghian Insurgency of 2347, with him serving in the chaotic battle for the city, running logistics between two posts while doubling as an unofficial markspony. His involvement was insignificant in the scale of things, but his contribution to the understaffed logistics was notable. This was probably the first time Medical put his affinity with paperwork, logistics, and bureaucracy to properly serve the Empire. He would also brave the dust storms to escort logistics to get them into the inner sections of Callujah for troops separated from the rest of the forces and would serve with distinction within the inner portions of the city.
                            </p><p>
                            Interestingly, during the chaos that was Callujah, he would meet his now wife Stylus Pen von Awan, who was also serving her military conscription, albeit within the Colonial garrison. Attached during the seventeenth day of the conflict, Medical would act as an amateur spotter whilst Stylus acted as a sharpshooter, as most Pegasi would, in order to scout out a section for logistics to pass through. Occasionally switching roles, the two would be inseparable since then. After the two months of the insurgency, Medical would continue connecting with Stylus while still on deployment. Several soldiers would note how the two became a single pairing with how often the two would be spotted either at the logistics section or on patrol in the interior of Callujah. After their one year service was up, Stylus and Medical would marry upon their honourable discharge from the military. In 2348 ALB, Medical Atlas and Stylus Pen would marry with a military ceremony, surrounded by military friends.
                            </p><p>
                            Medical and Stylus would settle with their military severance package, sweetened by them seeing combat, in Xiahe. Medical would enrol in the local bureaucracy - using his military rank to secure a decent position - and finding himself in tune with the nature of the bureaucracy. He found it easy to navigate the realms of it and saw himself rise through the bureaucratic ranks. Whilst at the same time, using the newfound income to fund his re-enrollment and enrollment in university and graduating with a double degree of epidemiology, and statistics. Additionally, after two years of being ailed with alcoholism, Medical finally was rid of the addiction with help from his wife.
                            </p><p>
                            Medical had originally planned to enrol in a hospital or a research group to utilize his skills properly. However, he was enticed by a job offer by the Ministry of Administrative Affairs to participate within the Neibudanereviewzburo (Office of Internal fund inspection) in 2358 ALB. Jumping hooves first into the Bureaucracy, Medical used his logistics experience to navigate through the paperwork with ease. And uncovering of a couple of corruption schemes, including the then Neibudanereviewzburofurher, which led to him usurping him and becoming the head of the office.
                            </p><p>
                            The altitude Medical portrayed, was one of workaholic professionalism. Never-ending work as he seeks to fulfil whatever job his superiors wanted him to do. Corruption within the lower half of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs saw a decrease during the period in which Medical was in charge, leading to him being placed into good graces with the then Minister Yunus of Administrative Affairs. Notably being invited for the annual Inter-Ministerial Conference of 2360 ALB, where Medical would be properly introduced to the other Ministers of the State - even including the Kaisar himself.
                          </p><p>
                            Using the connections built from that meeting, Medical would create and head the Ministerial Committee for Ministries' Internal Fund Review which lasted from 2361 to 2363, in which a joint project by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Administrative Affairs aimed in rooting out more internal corruption within most ministries. With him, at the helm, the Committee would successfully root out 192 different cases of kickback, embezzlement, and laundering. This alone was more than enough to get Medical into the circle of trusted the Kaisar had. The circle of the "Admitted". Traditionally, the "Admitted' was a circle of close friends the Kaisar had who would often advise him on political matters and public policy. And Medical's gift of dealing with paperwork was praised by the Kaisar as something fit for a Minister, and he had brought him into the circle in order to see what else this young bureaucrat could advise and do.
                          </p><p>
                            From 2364 to 2367, Medical would be on various committees by the Kaisar's command in order to speed up and improve performance, mostly getting to know more and more individuals from within the various ministries, and creating a ring of friends, allowing him to properly coordinate efforts, call favours and such with much ease. Such connections would lead to Medical being appointed as SeketariatMinisterVerwaltungsangelegenheiten (Secretary of the Minister of Administrative Affairs) in 2369 ALB, which he wanted solely for the higher pay and benefits which extended to his immediate family. And such an appointment was accompanied by news of Stylus giving to two healthy twins, named Article Mappenin von Kartogrefi-Pen Yang, and Elizabeth Ineaich von Kartogrefi-Pen Yang.
                          </p><p>
                            After being appointed to SeketariatMinisterVerwaltungansgelegenheiten, it was clear from then on that Medical would be the most likely candidate to replace the ageing Minister Yunus. As the Minister aged, his mind simply couldn't hold on to the insanity of the bureaucracy as he did since his appointment in 2358. Delegating more and more tasks to Medical who began to gain more and more power by delegation. But more importantly experience. Medical would become more familiar with running a Ministry rather than carrying out the duties of the Ministry as time went on. And he would eventually take Yunus' seat upon his death in 2372 ALB from a stroke.
                          </p><p>
                            Medical would become the youngest Minister to ever be appointed in the history of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs in the last two hundred years, and he began rolling out various programs to properly streamline various sections of the MineLegoEquestrian Bureaucracy. Medical's efforts would lead to a more extensive and more efficient bureaucracy. He would also seek to improve communication between the various Ministries, implementing the Xiahe-Manehatten Protocol which eased information sharing between Ministries with similar agendas, and more extensive oversight regarding financial management.
                          </p><p>
                            Medical would also implement more protocols in order to speed up the deployment of policies, and also initiate more crackdowns on internal corruption. Medical acted without a clear goal in mind except for the abstract goal of, well, improving anything and everything in order to try and make the Ministry the best there is. This mindset would become a goal Medical proclaimed in 2377 ALB upon the anniversary of his five-year Ministership.
                          </p><p>


                            "My son, dear little Article said to me once that math was hard, well everyone knows that. And he asks if he could just get by with a 76. Well, I asked him, but what if everyone has a 77? Is a 76 enough? He said no because it meant he'd be last and so he needs to get 77 at least. And then I asked him if everyone else has 78 on the next test, and if that is enough? You can see where I'm going with this. We cannot be content with what we can do now, we need to constantly strive to improve. We must be discontent, always to continue to grow, after all, we're not gods are we?"
                            - Medical Atlas, during his annual Ministerial speech in 2377 ALB.	
                          </p><p>

                            Medical's goals would result in a reformation similar to the efforts of Minister Desmoor Leichtan in the mid-late 1400s. With the intention of rooting out corruption that had grown to unprecedented levels in recent years, Medical would be more ruthless. In comparison to previous Ministers who left the justice system to deal with it, Medical would implement more draconian measures which aimed to root out corruptors and embezzlement, notably by the strengthening of the Neibudanereviewzburo to almost dictatorial levels, allowing them to search the records of any bureaucrat without a warrant. This move was praised mostly by libertarians and smaller government advocates who had for decades criticised the lacklustre anti-corruption efforts by the Ministry. Medical would also pass more Ministerial Orders than the previous ten Ministers combined within a decade of his service.
                          </p><p>
                            By this alone, Medical was given the nickname "Papermonger" simply due to the amount of paperwork that travelled from his office to the rest of the Bureaucracy. By this point, people were beginning to whisper, could he possibly be the next "Favoured Minister"? The mythos regarding 'Favoured Ministers' is one engrained in the history of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs. Where great Ministers were reportedly blessed by an apparently sapient Ministry which granted them gifts and wishes for serving with such excellence. For example, Minister Lichten von Rechvaren Yang was blessed by the Ministry with a child of her own. This on its own may be seen as a twisting of natural phenomenon and that Lichten simply had an extra-marital affair. However, the problem with this theory was medical records revealing traces of ink, paper, and book covers within a DNA sample taken of the newborn child. Mysticisms surround the exact nature of the Ministry, and such mysticisms began to surround Medical in 2387 ALB when the Ministry when dark for twenty-five hours, one minute, twenty-three seconds, and twenty-six milliseconds.
                          </p><p>
                            For the duration of the Ministerial shutdown, Medical was locked in his office with Stylus Pen, and the SeketariatMinisterVerwaltungansgelegenheiten, Lavender von Fletcher. It is still unclear what exactly happened within the office during the duration of the blackout, however Medical has revealed several things, indicating that the Ministry had promised him great things two weeks after his sixtieth birthday. That he would rise above his predecessors, and his line would bring glory to the Rechvaren, Leichtan, and Kartogrefi family lines.
                          </p><p>
                            Apart from this one event, Medical's life was undisturbed. He would continue the various works he had done, creating the Committee of Inter-Ministry Anti Corruption Efforts as a way to continue his crusade against kickbacks within the Ministry. An expansion of the small Burolehringprogam (Office Apprenticeship Program) and many more small scale program expansions would be a trait of the last years of this era of his life.
                          </p><p>          
                            On the 8th of February 2389, 11:47 am, Medical Atlas was appointed as Imperial Regent by the Kaisar himself. It is common knowledge that whoever rules the Ministry of Administrative Affairs is often the not, close friend of the Immortal Kaisar. And Medical was no different, talking with the Kaisar on a weekly basis regarding various different matters and problems facing the Empire as a whole. He was close enough to the imperial family itself till Elizabeth and Article could possibly be one of the few people to have received some form of education from the old stallion, Governor-Jenderal Preventus I.
                          </p><p>
                            Medical Atlas would ascend to the highest throne to the land following the attempted coup by his former colleague Minister Raven of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After a dramatic showdown at the Imperial Palace itself, a tired Medical and Kaisar were said to have conversed on the hard asphalt as the government forced itself to restore order whilst the Kaisar rocked back and forth on the ground, holding the lifeless body of the dead Minister Raven. Seemingly, there was little difference between the two, both were fathers that were workaholics, and had a larger than life reputation to stand up to. Several MineLegoEquestrian Politicians have noted how the Kaisar had taken Medical under his wing since 2364 ALB, and expected a similar political stance on matters like the Kaisar himself. An un-interventionist Kaisar, one favouring of favouring the status quo.
                          </p><p>
                            This seemingly same nature was quickly thrown out of the window with how interfering Medical was. Compared to the Kaisar, Medical was more opt for Government Non-Interference in the economy was more aligned to the Snowlandian economic school of thought. Less Government regulation was better for the overall economy, but only in certain parts. Under Medical Atlas several company regulations, franchising regulations, and others cut, but most of the larger regulations like social responsibilities, economic practices, and punitive tariffs still remained in place. Additionally, union rights, worker rights also saw an expansion under his initial reign. His bills to the Federal Parliament saw support from an odd coalition of old conservative parties and left-leaning progressive parties. Socially, Medical Atlas took the same approach as the Kaisar. Continued reaffirmation of the place of the church within the state to maintain morality, and displays that he too was a family man. Public appearances with his family in tow was a key tool in securing early support to ensure a smooth transition to his administration. Medical has inherited the Kaisar's hard stance against any deviation from the Christian definition of family. Backing traditional organisations within the Commonwealth as a whole, and has had launched tirades against liberalist parties.
                          </p><p>
                            Administration wise, Medical has also continued the Kaisar's habit of investing within in emerging cooperations and mass education projects. With the goal of encouraging economic growth whilst strengthening the position of the Imperial Family in the eyes of the people. This was mostly a precaution taken by him, knowing for a fact that he did not have the reverance of the people just like how the Kaisar did. Polling compared the Kaisar and saw him averaging around a 78% approval rating for the duration of his administration.
                          </p><p>
                            Medical’s administration would soon face a crisis, now colliqually referred to as the ‘October Insurrection’, in which an attempt would be made to seize power from him by malignant members of the Imperial Family. This attempt has lead to a noticeable shift in Medical’s rule post-recovery, with his wife being granted more power and an increased focus on internal security.

                            Stylus Pen I von Awan was born on the 21st of May 2326 ALB. According to an available source she was described as a cheerful young filly, being raised by Wind Duster von Awan and Feathery Pens von Zucker-Awan. It is hard to discern the exact details of Stylus youthhood, as she was raised in the more anarchistic regions of Baltimare, but it could be noted that Stylus enrolled in the local school, with MineLegoEquestrian as her strong suit. It isn’t really known a lot regarding her upbringing, but several have described her bubbly personality and outgoingness as ‘amazingly adorable’. Stylus was remarked to be quite intelligent for age, notably being interested in the political activities of her parents, several old photographs dating to the 2330s would display the young filly jumping around them.
                          </p><p>
                            This happy early life would stay relatively intact, despite several close brushes with disaster with her parents participating in many anarchist-syndicalist movements and activities of the 2330s and 2340s, notably the Shinzaka Strikes. Stylus’ skill would be seen with her mastery of the pen when she began writing for the local newspaper, the Baltimare Sun, when she was sixteen. Her ideals from the beginning seemed to resonate heavily with her family’s working class background, with clear traits of syndicalism and anarchism scattered among her writings. Bureaucratic paperwork would reveal her association and membership in the local newspaper union. It is unknown how much activity she partook in during this period of her life, Stylus’ herself claims that she only got involved with other journalists for discussing the next big scoop or theory.
                          </p><p>
                            Stylus would serve out her Military Service immediately upon graduating vocational school in 2346 ALB, reportedly in order to get the thing done as quickly as possible. Several reports from within the military bureaucracy revealed nothing out of the ordinary for the mare. Signing up as a Riflemare within the IGLD, for the duration of her service she would serve as a simple Riflemare, unremarkable apart from the fact for scoring as the best sharpshooter of her class. After basic training, Stylus would be deployed as part of the GRIJ-IKG to the Callujah Colonial Garrison, in Western Griffonia of Equestria-28.
                          </p><p>
                            During the insurgency in Callujah, Stylus would be noted to serve distinctively. It is rumoured - most records dictate that she herself started the rumour - of the number of her kills. Roughly around 43 is the most agreed upon number for the total amount she shot during the Insurgency, despite her claims of around 70. Her actions in the insurgency were mostly unremarkable apart from the development of a romance she acquired with her spotter, Medical Atlas I von Kartogrefi. Romances within the Imperial and Colonial Garrisons are phenomena that are to be expected by the administration - mostly due to the conscripted nature of the entire affair - so this was allowed to blossom. Several soldiers and officers would note how the two became a single pairing with how often the two would be spotted either at the logistics section or on patrol in the interior of Callujah. Rumours circulated regarding how the two ended up meeting, the most common one being that the two first met during a routine inspection and kicked it off, another suggested that the two met during the start of the insurgency. Regardless, after their one year service was up, Stylus and Medical would marry upon their honourable discharge from the military. In 2346 ALB, Medical Atlas and Stylus Pen would marry with a military ceremony, surrounded by military friends.
                          </p><p>
                            Stylus and Medical would settle with their military severance package, sweetened by them seeing combat, in Xiahe. While Medical would enrol in the Bureaucracy in order to finance his return to medical studies, Stylus would return to the world of Journalism in order to continue her task of advancing the ideologies of syndicalism and anarchism. She would begin her work with the Kiria Leftist, a clearly left leaning news cooperative. It would be noted that there would be a conflict within the news cooperative, as supposedly the social democrats and syndicalists would split over a matter. It is unknown what this matter is, but Stylus would end up siding with the syndicalists, leading to her induction into the local Association of Kirian Anarchists and Syndicalists (A-KAS) in 2349 ALB. Her involvement in this Association would see her covering union protests and various socialist activities, but she would be most famous for her investigative journalism regarding the activities of various organisations and government officials. Her involvement in starting the Jianghe Scandal would make her name famous among the leftist organisations, and would attract opponents to a rising syndicalist star.
                          </p><p>
                            Stylus would come under fire in 2351 ALB, being accused of being a statist infiltrator by the more radical factions of A-KAS. This accusation was followed by the accusers stating Stylus’ husband being a middle level ranking bureaucrat in the bureaucracy. Stylus’ and her supporters would fire back stating the lack of involvement from said radical factions during the Jianghe scandal. It is suspected that she had drawn the ire of the gregoist and the lienanist factions of the Syndicalists, and thus caused this entire scandal. In fear of a potential split of the organisation on the eve of an important election in 2352 ALB, the party leaders would dismiss Stylus from the organisation. The radical factions would seize the initiative upon this chance and convince the Association of Baltimare Anarchists to kick Stylus out as well.
                          </p><p>
                            Such a move would break Stylus, for the fact that this had been her life up until now. This situation would break even by the disownment of her by her parents after her expulsion from the ABA. After suffering a mental breakdown that lasted a month, Stylus would find herself being enrolled in the Bureaucracy. Medical had suggested the idea, saying that if she wanted to continue working, the bureaucracy had an opening in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where she could work as a secretary. Stylus decided to join in 2354 ALB in order to help cover the two’s life in Xiahe.
                          </p><p>
                            Due to her ousting from the anarchists, Stylus would find herself swamped in a world which she had minimal experience in. Stylus herself would describe her initial years within the bureaucracy as chaotic and stressful compared to the relative calmness that was journalism and activism within the syndicalist and anarchist organisations. However, despite such problems, like her husband, she would be taken notice of by the higher ups of the Ministries. Noting how well she could do in rooting out corruption by complete accidents. Her ability to engage in investigative journalism would lead to her being fast tracked to a position within the NeiBuDanaReviewzburo (Internal Financial Review Office). Stylus Pen would make a name for herself when Medical got promoted horizontally to the position of Neibudanareviewzburofurher. This made Stylus within the bureaucracy famous as a fanatic anti-corruption figure.
                          </p><p>
                            During this phase of her life, Stylus would give birth to Article Mappenin von Kartogrefi-Pen Yang and Elizabeth Ineaich von Kartogrefi-Pen Yang. She chose to use ‘Pen’ as a surname so out of anger of being disowned by her parents, intending on making her own family line. After Medical’s promotion to Secretary to the Minister of Administrative Affairs, Stylus would find herself becoming the Neibudanreviewzburofurher. This is a position she would hold from 2358 ALB until 2370 ALB where she would be appointed as the Under Secretary for Foreign Politics within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from 2371 onwards.
                          </p><p>
                            During this time between 2360 until 2370 ALB, Stylus would be a figure among the local unions of Kiria and the provinces of Leichu, MineLegotian Canterlot, and Xiandao. Her reputation as a proper anti-corruption figure would see her gain popularity among the local unions, who praised her for her effective actions and a role model leftist. Stylus would soon be invited several times by these unions to be a speaker in several seminars regarding proper governance. These unions were notably anti-syndicalist, due to the nature of MineLegotian and Kirinese worker culture compared to Equestrian and Baltimarean worker cultures. Thus, despite protests form A-KAS, Stylus would be inducted as a member of the GUA (Governmental Unions Association).
                          </p><p>
                            This perceived closeness to the unions would see her being dispatched occasionally by the Bureaucracy as a representative of the government in talks with the unions during this time. Through her involvement many would credit her for the rise of leftism during the elections of 2364 and 2369, which helped provide an image of strong and proper unions.
                          </p><p>
                            The chaos of the January Coup would see Stylus eventually raised to as Minister of Foreign Affairs following the execution of her predecessor, Minister Raven Inkewell by lightning strike. The chaotic nature of her arrangement would see internal chaos and opposition to her rule. But after a proper mandate by the Kaisar and approval of the Unions, Stylus’ rule would be properly solidified as Minister of Foreign Affairs.A main problem faced by her, was the systematic autocracy implemented by her predecessor, which ensured that most issues when through the office of the Minister. A structural reorganisation would be undertaken by Stylus, sorting the Minister of Foreign Affairs into several sections. The Section of Foreign Politics, the Section of Foreign Aid, the Section of Special Affairs, and the Section of Section Management. This management also followed a massive reorganisation that Stylus would undertake, ensuring that the Ministry was able to do many things without needing permission nor immediate supervision from the Minister and that the personnel within these positions would be competent and non-rebellious.
                          </p><p>
                            Like all politics within the MineLegoEquestrian bureaucracy, several dozen personnel died during this affair. Several attempts to unseat her, several attempts to assassinate her, followed by several attempts to just outright commit treason were defeated. This situation and predicament would see Stylus forming the Section of Internal Security in order to ensure… internal security. Under her instructions, Stylus would be managing the reassurance of foreign nations regarding the stability of the nation and that the Empire would maintain its various commitments overseas. Stylus would be also one to assure of a ‘more active and caring’ Empire in foreign affairs, committing even higher to foreign interventions with clearance from her husband to do so.
                          </p><p>
                            Post-October Insurrection, it would be revealed that Stylus would have been managing an attempt to quell said insurrection early on. A plot was attempted in order to discredit her, which evolved into discrediting the Acting-Kaisar and Minister of Administrative Affairs, Medical Atlas. She would be involved in preventing her own discreditment, however be used as propaganda against Medical Atlas, by claiming her - and Medical’s secretary, Lavender Fletcher - as puppeteers of the bureaucrat in order to enact the end of the Empire. A photograph would soon emerge, claiming that they were mind controlling Medical, and would culminate in the storming of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs and the declaration that she and Medical were false rulers.
                          </p><p>
                            Stylus would contact the local unions in order to lay siege to the Ministry, and would be at the forefront, managing the forces in an attempt to force Wleian II to step down and stop the insurrection. Upon the chaotic scenes that would unfold upon Medical’s arrivals and attempted assassination, Stylus would be seen charging along the waves of workers descending upon the MInistry. Supposedly being the one to end up killing Wleian II and his conspirators.
                            </p><p>
                            Upon this event, Stylus would be hastily crowned by the Commonwealth and MineLegoEquestrian states as the Stylus Pen the First as Acting-Acting-Kaisarin for the two weeks Medical would be in a coma for. And in these two weeks, Stylus would enact her vengeance upon those who dared conspired against her and her family. A ‘purge’ - based - not unlike those conducted in the past would take place, with the MDIS and the Neibudanareviewzburo temporarily empowered to seek out those that were deemed to have sided or assisted with the conspirators among the bureaucracy. This purge would claim the life of supposedly, three thousand (3000) individuals and ended in the reorganisation of most of the Bureaucracy, and the firing of six Ministers from their post under suspicion of conspiracy.
                            </p><p>
                            This would garner more approval from the Unions across MineLegotia and Equestria, because Stylus would be seen as a move to kick out the corrupt and ensure new blood could enter into the Bureaucracy.
                            </p><p>
                            Under her brief rule, Stylus would also pass several orders allowing the strengthening of the Commonwealth nations regarding Commonwealth affairs. Presumably under an attempt to ensure that in the case the Empire was hijacked, a defence could be put up by the rest of the Commonwealth. This effort would include reenacting a proposal set up by the Kaisar by was never finished. Proposal 4823281829031903WHFDUEU. This Proposal, would however, remain unfinished upon Medical’s recovery.
                            </p><p>
                            Upon Medical’s recovery, Medical would appoint Stylus as Acting-Kaisarin, stating that ‘One is none, but two is one because coma’. Now, people are disputed wheter or not Medical has brain damage. That’s okay. All bureaucrats have brain damage. So it was reassuring to the people when Stylus Pen was appointed as Acting-Kaisarin. Seeing that - as far as we knew - she did not have brain damage. Thus, Stylus was welcomed as a perceived counterweight to the conservative Medical.
                            </p><p>
                            From upon her appointment, Stylus would enact several laws to empower the internal security forces. Most of these did not past after the National Parliament disapproves of such notions. However, despite these failures Stylus would pass several laws regarding devolution successfully.

                            Born to the previous Kolonialjenderal, Octavia XXII, and Alucard II von Leopold, Octavia XXIII was by most metrics, an average mare. Her mother was colloquially known as 'The Subsidies Mare' due to the number of subsidies handed out during her reign, and this resulted in a large economic growth which she would eventually ride during her ascension to power. Octavia would be raised in a traditional Equestrian household during the 'Golden Subsidy Years' of the 2360s and early 2370s. Octavia at first would be sheltered in the hallways of the Governor's Palace, having limited contact with people other than her personal maid and parents, who were wary of exposing her to the outside world so quickly.
                          </p>
                          <p>In 2364 ALB, she would finally be exposed to the outside world as she enrolled in an offshoot of the prestigious MineLegoEquestrian Boarding Schools in New Manehatten. Famous primarily for their legacy of educating members of the von Javert family, Octavia would be educated in the realms of modern science, sociology, philosophy, macroeconomics, and also theology from an early age. The influence of MineLegoEquestrian education norms being clear in such schools meant that no topic too complex to be taught to young minds. As such, Octavia from early on would be exposed to a thing called 'Supply Chain Management'. Octavia would be fascinated with such a topic and sought out to figure out how to solve problems within it. With how important MineLegotipony is with providing the Empire with goods, she tried to figure out how best to supply such goods. Supply Chain Management is a complicated topic, and often the not has more than thousands of moving parts that one needed to focus on, and no mortal could possibly do that. Looking at this entire topic that MineLegotipony faced, Octavia would ask her parents what was the most important part of providing such goods, and her predecessor said that it was getting the goods on time. But how could goods be provided on time? She looked more into the topic and figured that inefficiencies and a lack of general coordination could be the cause. Proposing that if the government merely helped with cutting down inefficiencies, coordinated more central transportation routes, then the supply chain would be much more streamlined. She was so convinced with her hypothesis, even going so far as to write three different scientific papers regarding the importance of cutting down inefficiencies and national integration was to the proper providing of goods.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            When she graduated university in 2380 ALB, Octavia had plans to get involved in the local economy by joining Imperial-MineLegotiponyian Transportation Incorporated, where she had interned during her high school years in order to enter the university in the first place. And she did for a single year, where she was placed in charge of Section 48A of MineLegotipony, an iron-steel producing region. There, she built skills and honed her abilities in management. She would have had a prosperous career in the corporation, as many of her coworkers and bosses foresaw, but was cut short by the sudden death of her parents during the New Manehatten Airport bombing of 2381 ALB.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Octavia was quickly escorted into political office by MineLegoEquestrian Colonial Blackshirts, sworn in, and given full control over the large nation. The panicky young mare had no idea what to do in office, and using the few skills she did have in management, did her best to secure power in a state that could have any moment collapsed into rebellion from the uprising outside of New Manehatten by Shy Cultists. Here, during the first years of her reign, would it become clear the policy she took against those who rebelled against her power, pure unadulterated militaristic repression. Decried by Hyper Equestrians as a MineLegotiponyian Tiananmen Square, Octavia in a single move and massacre of twenty thousand cultists, secured her power and control over the vast lands. Appointing her mother's assistant, Shandian Strike von Fletcher, as Verwalterguanliao and gave her the task of stamping out the murderers of her parents. A brutal war, colloquially now known as The Extermination, that still rages on today in some regions, would take the lives of sixty thousand MineLegotiponyians. Mainly cultists, and only a few MineLegotiponyian soldiers.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            With the cultist threat under control, Octavia began rolling out her plans for even more national integration. Centralising several sections under more powerful 'seksizhuliguans' whose main task was to better coordinate transportation routes. And her efforts did bear fruit, more and more products were being rolled out per week under her watch, and that she was praised for such from MineLegotian Canterlot. This allowed her to see large economical growth, built on the growth financed by her mother. The subsidies she had loaned out had begun paying dividends which she used to finance her integration efforts, creating vast railways and aqueducts for the transportation of goods. Under her rule, MineLegotipony has also begun opening up to foreign markets other than the Commonwealth. Developing markets in Indonesia and India has led to the opening up of MineLegotipony. Additional opening up has been done in relation to the Confederation, with the state having relations within the Confederation Imperial Senate. Pushing Harmonic Imperialist thought through the Senator Tailspin XXIII von Javehin.

                            Octavia married said Senator in 2389 ALB. After a decade of sole rulership over MineLegotipony accompanied by Shanddian, she is now accompanied by Tailspin in the rulership over this nation. No clear deviation from her initial policies have been since Tailspin marrying Octavia, apart from the resurgence of Keynesian and Preventusian practices that Octavia's mother once did, hinting towards another period of the 'Subsidies Age'. But these rumours have yet to be proven by any recent political activities from New Manehatten.

                      <hr>
                      <p>Based in the story of <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/467562/rekindled-embers" class="link-color-unique">Rekindled Embers</a> written by Applezombi, there was a roleplay taking place on the RE Discord Server. And from hence popped up a bunch of OCs that I created for the sole purpose of roleplay and creation of narratives regarding the development of governmental and institutional identities, in addition to the social-economical situation present within a society that results and allows for the formation of unique structures and narratives within the noosphere of governmental procedures... I just like roleplaying as the Vigilants<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Bureaucrats but if Bureaucrats were all Knights<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Oh God they're British</span>.</span> alright?</p>

                          <hr class="m-1">
                          <ul>
                            <li>Knight-Lieutanent of the Vigilants, Office of Provincial Administrative Affairs</li>
                            <li>45 years old</li>
                            <li>Born: 21st April 1074 AF </li>
                          </ul>
                          <hr class="m-1">
                          <p>Born to a love affair betwenen Sir Medical Atlas - a spy from the Crystal Empire posing as a Knight-Captain of the Vigilants - and Lady Stylus Pen - a Knight-Captain of the Adamants, soon to be defector and Knight-Captain of the Discordants. Due to the circumstances of his birth to a Knight Adamant with a Knight Vigilant<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Knight Vigilants had a Oath of Chastity and Sobriety</span>, he was transferred over and raised by an Accural Incentive and his wife, Scalable Synergy. Offshoots of the same family Sir Atlas hailed from.</p>
                          <p>From a young age, the colt showed capabilities well in mathemathics and general shenanigary, well expected of a pony born into a bloodline of Inkbloods<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Inkblood: A xenotype of ponies modified to be supberb at administrative staffs at the cost of mental health.</span>. His childhood was filled with learning, the usual few anomalies with paperwork, and the occasional apperentince under other family members in order to attain skills that a proper Inkblood should have. When he reached the years of teenagership, he was shipped off to join the Knighthood in the order of the Vigilants as all thirdborns in the Kartogrefi Family were destined to do.</p>
                          <p>His squireship in the Knighthood began in 1092 was irremarkable apart from the death of his mentor Sir Dice Roll died in an archive fire, as such had been mentored partly by a Sir Atlas from the Vigilants - his original biological father, however he would not of such fact till much later. He would be specialised into the field of the Office of Provincial Administrative Affairs, a posistion which basically said 'career death' and 'irrelevancy in the greater scheme of things'.</p>
                          <p>For most of his early career, Dipoly would be part of Sir Atlas' entourage, assisting him in various criminal investigations and financial audits. As was the nature of travelling Vigilants, the entourage contained a variety of people who came and went, and allowed the intrepid young stallion to gain connections which would help him later on. Of particular was a two year companionship with a <strong>Lady Inked Tear</strong> to which the two grew close. However, considering their posistions as Knight Vigilants they weren't allowed to foster such a beautiful young relationship, and quietly cut it off to prevent their fall to heresy.</p>
                          <p>Dipoly would garner a reputation as a papermonger over the years, a fact that shined his inkblood nature, and one that was standard for all bureaucrats. He would grow suspicious over the years as he realised that Sir Atlas too had the abilities similar to an Inkblood, and a quiet confrontation led to the revelation of his Inkblood nature as well. For bureaucrats, duty was above petty issues such as loyalities, colours, and nations, and such Dipoly didn't report the fact that Sir Atlas was a spy, workign with the Discordant, and most importantly broke the Oath of Chastity. So the two would bond, and attempt to repair their relationship which was strained by the nature of both of their posistions. Sir Atlas would have to leave the Diarchy not a decade later after their reunion.</p>
                          <p>Of note, is his stint in Sweethaven around 1106 AF, in which many shenanigans occured.</p>
