                      <h2>Kaisarverse OCs</h2>
                      <hr>
                      <p>To summarise, the Kaisarverse is a setting in which most of my writing occurs. Taking place in a multiversal empire which calls itself 'MineLegotia and Equestria',  an Empire that pierced the secrets of interuniversal travel in the wake of its great war, and began to spread among the different stories found in the Multiverse. But it is an Empire in constant flux and debate within itself, debating what is right and wrong.  The state is a contradiction, for an Empire is never a monolithic leviathan, and instead a series of individuals acting out their own lives amidst a convoluted political structure. Backstabs, hope, glory, tragedy, horrors, joy, romance, and a variety more are found in the Empire. And these OCs live in a state trying to assert its own ability to live up to its ideals yet struggling every step in trying to do so. To either live by ink or to be condemned to death by it.

                            Medical Atlas von Kartogrefi Yang was born on the 25th of January 2326 in an unassuming hospital in the Western Manehatten District. He was one of the 39.4 million born in the first quarter of 2326, and was insignificant and inseparable apart from the fact he was born into the family of Atom van Kartogrefi Yang and Velvet Articulate da Munensch. A family with a legacy of servitude to the MineLegoEquestrian Bureaucracy. Medical would grow up with three different siblings, Dimethane Polynominal, Scienti Johnathan Rechtan, Inked Tear, and Tripoly Equilibilirum. The first few years of life would be defined by the adoration of the Kartogrefi and Munensch family, for being the first of both families' new generation.
                          </p><p>
                            Despite such adoration, the personality developed in the early stages of Medical's life was of a secluded introvert. Seemingly more keen to be playing by himself with his toys rather than playing with his siblings, but still exhibiting the usual traits of an older brother. Protective of Scienti in particular. Probably due to the fact that Scienti like imitating Medical and tried to follow in his brother's hoofsteps. Family members would note how Medical would always keep an eye and cover for the troublesome Scienti.
                          </p><p>
                            Medical would enrol in a private school according to his father's wishes, and saw himself pass mainly mathematics and biology with ease. Here his abilities for bureaucratic management would first emerge in the form of relentless pursuit of a solution to a mathematical solution. During this part of his life, it should be noted of the thawing of his introverted ways and had begun to build a small circle of friends in which he could confide in. However, the relative safety and normalcy of his life would shatter when Scienti died of a medical complication, and the parents noted how he broke down over the death. Rejecting that Scienti had died and still believing him to be away, before finally accepting his death in 2340, a year after Scienti's death.
                          </p><p>
                            His excellence within the realm of mathematics would persist along with his natural talent within biology all the way until university. Where he would enroll in the Technical University of Manehatten (TUM) in 2344. Now during his time in the TUM, he would develop romantic feelings for a fellow student, Lavender, who he knew since high school. Everything was going well for him before it all fell apart in 2346 with the death of Lavender. Police reports dictate Lavender's death to be a suicide, and Medical's life broke down. Not knowing how to deal with the lost of another one he cared about, led to him fleeing Manehatten and temporarily dropping off the radar of his friends and family.</p>
