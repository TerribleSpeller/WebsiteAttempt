An Epideomologist by trade, it is an anomalous phenomena seen in the Bureaucracy. But alas, the system and the way it works had worked for years before, and it still works now so no one was stopping the apparent rise of an Epidemologist among the tight knit ranks of Bureaucrats as long as he fit the bill: pedantic, efficient, amoral, obstructive, and seemingly sleepless. Overtime, the stallion had risen up to Ministerial Secretary for the Minister of Administrative Affairs. And when his predecessor finally passed, it was obvious for the Administration and the Kaisar to appoint him in their steed. And a stallion of such stature is of course, of no ordinary nature. A stallion from a line said to be blessed by the goddess of Administration, it is no wonder his abilities are amazing and effective. With the touch of the divine upon him, only time will reveal upon the rest what machinations he has for his Empire, his people, and his family.

A syndicalist journalist who fell in love with her spotter during her national service, she was soon taken on a wild journey as her husband ascended the ladder of power. At first, she was estatic at the chance of actually implementing reforms through the conduit of her husband - espicially after being thrown out by the unions she once called her family. The continued involement of Medical up the ranks saw Stylus shift eastwards in her ideology towards Social Democracy, abandoning her younger self's anarchistic tendencies. She saw herself rise in fame thanks to the use of her husband's position to break stories of investigative nature, a tad, corrupt method in giving herself fame and power, but it worked as she saw herself offered a position in the NeiBuDanaReviewzburo - and later on, as NeiBuDanaReviewzburofurher, then, Minister of Foreign Affairs. With her power... Stylus knows she can do the right thing. She hopes she can actually do it..

A posistion which allows for an effective ear in the realm of the most powerful of the Empire and one also the best suited for scandals as well, due to the propensity for leaders to pick some secretaries with interesting 'personalites'. And Lavender is no different. The result of some 'help' from Medical did help her get the posistion, but of course with such help came the whispering rumours of scandals and infidelity. Lavender, for all intent and purposes could hardly care less of such a situation. Sure, she might have engaged in a little bit of a-maritial coitus, but she's a damn good secretary. And for all she cares is that she does her job well so she can spend her time with the friends she loves dearly. After all, <span style="text-decoration:underline">what else does she have to live for?</span>

An earth pony from the Mleocunese hinterlands of 'Canterae', the stallion started out as a simple data science major who found himself hired by the CIA post-conscription. Good analysts are hard to come by in a world where AI once was much more. With his skills, he secured for himself a nice job along with a nice wife from MineLegotia, all was well. Well until his wife's family of... 'high influence' dragged him itno the drama of Imperial Politics. Now having been assigned to assist his in-laws, Dipoly felt himself doomed to a future of migraines and headaches. From being asked to tutor Article and Lizzie, to helping solve an assassination. Dipoly knows that his life and his wife's is about to become much, much more interesting than he had initially planned for in the past... well, at least the pay is nice.

Inked, is a lucky mare, having been one of the few able to reach such a goal, in her early thirties! It could be suppose that if your goal was just to become an agent in the CIA's many subagencies, it wasn't that amazing of an achievement, but an achievement noentheless it was for the mare trying to mimic in the paths of all those agents she read about when she was a wee filly. But like all things, once you finished the task, there were more that had to be done. And Inked flew through em as a pegasus should. Kicking out subversive agents, elminating 'threats' to national safety, along with starting her own family with the stallion she loved. And now, her family calls upon her help to increase security around the Ministers at the very top, in addition to taking care of Medical's and Stylus' adorable children. Life is great, for Inked Tear.
